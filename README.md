Note Sharing and Management Application
It is a dynamic web application aimed at improving user experience with sharing of notes within a group or to some specific user. It also facilitates convertionof image(s) into a pdf with ease.
This was a part of OOSE (Object oriented Software engineering) project which me made in a group of three.

This application was designed keeping in view the 'singleton' design pattern.
Technolofies used are - HTML, Javascript, CSS, PHP, JQURY, AJAX.
We used Mysql database for this app and tables were designed keeping in view the concepts of RDBMS (Relational Database).
